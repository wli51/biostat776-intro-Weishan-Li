Hello, Website!!!

## Hi, I am Weishan Li.<br/>  
\
\

I was born and raised in China. Then I came to the U.S. for my undergraduate studies and received a BS degree in Bioinforamtics from the Univeristy of California, San Diego. Finally, here I am at the Johns Hopkins University BSPH for my grauduate studies.

### Experiences
I spent a significant portion of undergrad years on analyzing calcium activity by mouse neurons. I wrote scripts in MATLAB for image processing (identifying positions cell bodies from a microscope FOV), calcium activity peak detection and denoising and eventually bundled them up into a tool pack with GUI.   


I learned the operation of several statistics software package in my undergraduate classes. I have experience with mRNA differentiation analysis and GWAS using python and single cell genomics with a R package.

### Research Interests 
 I am currently interested in infectious disease modelling. Though I would say would happily engage in any Publich Health research that involves the development of new tools or methods. For that reason, I really look forward to learn coding in R in this couse as well as the development of packages in R, which, according to my knowedge, will be covered in Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows, a continuation of the current course, in term 2.

### Fun Facts about me:
1. Starting my undergrad Junior year, I oversleep on the first day of every school term and consistently missed my first lectures.  
2. According to family tradition, I am supposed to be given a name that pronounces the same as dinosaur in Chinese. I am glad that my parent did not follow that tradition.
3. I was into building my computer systems from parts during college and got one custom loop water cooled unit running for 6 month. Eventually I gave up because it takes time to maintain the system. 
4. To save up money for my PC building hobby, I learned to cook as soon as I entered college. 
5. The year if 2022 is the year of my zodiac animal (tiger), but counterintuitively, according to the myths this is supposed to be my unlucky year.
